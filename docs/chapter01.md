# Chapter 1. Introducing DreamFactory

No matter your role in today's IT industry, APIs are an inescapable part of the job. Marketers regularly integrate Salesforce, Pipedrive, and MailChimp APIs into campaigns, while colleagues in the software development department rely upon Stripe, Google Maps, and IBM Watson APIs to build compelling web applications. The data scientists down the hall are grappling with an increasingly unwieldy avalanche of company metrics using Amazon Machine Learning, Elasticsearch, and IBM EventStore APIs. Meanwhile, the executive team relies upon Geckoboard, Google Analytics, and Baremetrics to gauge company progress and future direction. 

In addition to integrating third-party APIs, your organization is likely deeply involved in the creation of internal APIs used to interact with proprietary data sources. But unlike the plug-and-play APIs mentioned above, manual API development is anything but a walk in the park. This process is incredibly time-consuming, error-prone, and ultimately a distraction from the far more important task of building compelling applications and infrastructure for your clientele.

This chapter makes a case for eschewing custom API development in preference for embracing an API management platform. 

## Introducing REST

Ultimately, REST is about declaring *what* you intend to do, and *where* you intend to do it. This is done by riding on the rails of two key HTTP components: the verb and URI. The verbs (also often referred to as methods) define the *what*, determining whether the client would like to retrieve, create, update, or delete a resource. The URI identifies the resource, and often works in conjunction with accompanying URI parameters or a request body. For instance, if you'd like to 

### REST Methods


#### GET

You'll use the GET method to retrieve both multiple records and information about a specific record. Multiple records could mean all records, or some as identified by a particular attribute such as those which have as `id` of `29`, a `price` column greater than `$19.99`, or which were created within the past 30 days.
