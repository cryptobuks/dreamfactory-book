# Getting Started with DreamFactory

Welcome to the DreamFactory platform! Whether you’re an open source user, or a paid customer taking advantage of DreamFactory’s advanced capabilities, we wrote this guide to help you begin incorporating the platform into your organization in the most efficient way possible.

## About this Guide

This guide consists of seven chapters, covering the following topics:

### [Chapter 1. Introducing DreamFactory](chapter01.md)

So why would you want to use the DreamFactory platform in the first place? It’s likely because even world class developers and administrators are faced with ever-increasing complexity due in large part to the extraordinary number of internal and third-party data sources which must be integrated with mobile and web applications, ERP solutions, and myriad other services. In this chapter you’ll learn how DreamFactory can bring order to this chaos by introducing silo breaking capabilities to your enterprise, offering a platform for which not only can you auto-generate the APIs used to connect to these data sources, but also secure and monitor them. 

### [Chapter 2. Installing and Configuring DreamFactory](chapter02.md)

Much of the DreamFactory platform is open source, with the code made available via GitHub. But this doesn’t mean you have to be a command-line wizard to begin generating APIs in a flash. In this chapter you’ll learn how to install and configure DreamFactory regardless of your operating system or experience level. We’ll also talk about configuring DreamFactory to suit your specific needs, and highlight key configuration changes which will make your life much easier.

### [Chapter 3. Generating a Database API](chapter03.md)

After installing your DreamFactory instance, it’s only natural to want to see what the platform can do. For most users, this means generating a database API, because the advantages of doing so are so evident. By merely supplying a set of authentication credentials, DreamFactory will generate an API for any of an array of popular databases, including MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and others. Once generated, you’ll be able to issue REST calls to carry out record creation, retrieval, modification, and deletion tasks. You’ll also be able to perform advanced queries using the REST API, including filters, grouping, joins, limiting, and more. 

### [Chapter 4. Securing Your API](chapter04.md)

From the moment your API is generated, rest assured it is protected by at minimum a complicated API key. However this represents only the beginning in terms of your options regarding securing an API. Using the DreamFactory platform you can create API-specific API keys, create read-only APIs, restrict database APIs to specific tables and capabilities, and limit API request volume.

### [Chapter 5. Generating a SOAP-to-REST API](chapter05.md)

The SOAP Protocol has long been instrumental to network-based data exchange, however over time REST has slowly gained influence within enterprises, with many DreamFactory users seeking to supplant their SOAP services with a REST-based solution.

### [Chapter 6. Integrating Business Logic](chapter06.md)

The DreamFactory team regularly works with customers around the globe to build highly customized services based atop our platform. Most often this involves using DreamFactory’s scripting feature, which allows you to write custom code used to validating input parameters, call other APIs, and much, much more.

### Chapter 7. Creating an API Mashup Using MySQL, Raspberry Pi and Twitter

Sometimes your API-related needs will be more sophisticated than what’s available by way of third-party canned solutions. In this chapter you’ll learn how to use DreamFactory’s scripting capabilities to merge multiple APIs together.

### Chapter 8. Troubleshooting Your APIs

Rest assured the DreamFactory platform is going to do an amazing job at generating your API. We can also guarantee you’ll soon thereafter curse DreamFactory when attempting to query that API. Chances are these initial challenges can be easily overcome using our troubleshooting guide in conjunction with a popular HTTP client. If not, in this chapter we’ll outline ways in which you can contribute to DreamFactory and help us improve the platform!
