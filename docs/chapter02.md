## Using an HTTP Client

Whether your API consumer is an iPhone or Android application, a SPA (Single Page Application), or another server altogether, that consumer is often referred to as the *client*. The client issues HTTP requests to the REST API, parsing the responses and reacting accordingly. Although in most cases your team will use libraries such as [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) or [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to manage these requests, you'll often want to interact with the APIs in a much more fluid manner during the investigatory and learning phase. The API Docs feature serves this need well, however the API Docs interface lacks the ability to bookmark and otherwise persist queries, manage parameters programmatically using variables, and other features useful for maintaining a set of easily accessible configurations.

Fortunately, there are a number of HTTP clients which fill this void very well. Two of the most popular are [Insomnia](TODO) and [Postman](TODO), which are available on OSX and multiple operating systems, respectively. In this section we'll introduce you to both HTTP clients, and as an added bonus talk about the ubiquitous cURL client which is quite possibly the most popular piece of software you've never heard of.
